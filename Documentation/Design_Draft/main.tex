\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Interpretation and Recommendations}
\paragraph{Key Findings}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Low Energy Consumption: Thera-Hand is energy-efficient in use.
    \item Minimal Carbon Footprint for PLA: The frame is eco-friendly, but plastics must be disposed
of properly.
    \item E-Waste Challenge: Sensors, servos, and the ESP32 must be recycled properly.
    \item Transportation Impact: If shipped globally, the CO$_2$ footprint increases.
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Recommendations}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Optimize 3D Printing Material: Use recycled PLA or biodegradable TPU to reduce waste.
    \item E-Waste Collection Plan: Offer a recycling take-back program for electronics.
    \item Reduce Servo Impact: Use low-power or energy-efficient servos if possible.
    \item Sustainable Packaging: Use biodegradable or recycled materials for packaging.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Conclusion}
\begin{itemize}
\item Thera-Hand is a low-energy, partially sustainable device.
\item The biggest environmental concern is e-waste disposal of sensors and servos.
\item Efforts to recycle electronic components and use sustainable materials can improve its
eco-friendliness.
\end{itemize}

    \item Repeat the process for each finger, ensuring consistency.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Ability to fit on a common hand}
The device should be able to fit securely and comfortably on common hand sizes, using straps for adjustability.

\paragraph{Goal} The device should securely fit common hand sizes without excessive gaps or pressure points. The adjustable straps should allow for a customized fit without discomfort. If fit issues arise, modifications to strap length, padding, or buckle placement may be necessary.

\paragraph{External factors} Impact of movement on strap security. Any noticeable discomfort due to prolonged wear.

\paragraph{Equipment} Robotic/assistive hand device with straps for adjustability. 3D hand model (male/female). Measuring tools for assessing gaps and pressure points (ruler, measuring tape, etc.). User feedback for qualitative comfortability assessment.

\paragraph{Steps}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Prepare the hand models and device with adjustable straps. Ensure straps are at their default adjustment before each trial.
    \item Measure the circumference of each hand model at the middle of the hand and forearm.
    \item Place the device on each hand model and secure it using the straps. Adjust the straps for a snug but comfortable fit.
    \item Record strap tension using measuring tape and pressure sensors.
    \item Conduct subjective assessment for comfort and stability.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Durability of the device}

\paragraph{Goal} The device should maintain functional integrity for at least 100,000 flexion cycles without significant degradation. The structural components should withstand typical impact forces without catastrophic failure. Environmental exposure should not lead to material breakdown or loss of functionality. If durability issues arise, material selection, mechanical design, or protective coatings may need revision.

\paragraph{External factors} Effects of prolonged use on mechanical performance. Environmental factors leading to premature material failure.

\paragraph{Equipment} Robotic/assistive hand device. Mechanical testing rig for repeated flexion cycles. Load cell sensors to measure stress and strain. Environmental chamber for temperature and humidity variations. Impact testing apparatus for drop and shock resistance.

\paragraph{Steps}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Mount the device on a mechanical testing rig.
    \item Calibrate sensors to measure force, stress, and performance degradation.
    \item Record initial material integrity and functionality metrics.
    \item Subject each finger mechanism to repeated flexion cycles (minimum 100,000 cycles).
    \item Monitor for signs of wear, stiffness, or failure.
    \item Drop the device from various heights onto different surfaces. 
    \item Assess structural damage and continued operability.
    \item Expose the device to temperature fluctuations (-10 Celsius to 50 Celsius) and high humidity.
    \item Evaluate material degradation and operational stability.
\end{enumerate}

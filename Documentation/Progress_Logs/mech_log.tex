\section*{2025-04-10}
Typed meeting notes from the meeting with the proffesor and shared it with the group. Added to the bill of materials and shared it with the proffesor. Discussed goals with the mech team such as finalizing the design and made issues for them. 

Found new hand model that would be more flexible than the current wooden one. The current wooden one is too stiff and would not work well for testing the device. 
Looked for different servo motors with Ethan and Andy. Goal was to look for one with more power that would be able to move a finger since the current one is too weak.

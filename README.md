## Need Statement
People with hand disabilities and injuries face challenges in attending
physical therapy sessions multiple times a week during their recovery period due to the demands of their lives. This will slow or reverse recovery
progress if sessions are insufficient or missed.

## Goal Statement
We aim to address this by providing a device that allows clients to perform their exercises at home, reducing in-person visits. Our goal is to make rehabilitation more convenient, accessible and efficient, allowing
clients to have more control over their recovery.

## Design Objective
We aim to reduce physical therapy visits by up to 50%, subsequently reducing insurance costs.
